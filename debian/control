Package: libshine

Description: Shine fixed-point MP3 encoding library
 shine is a library for encoding mp3 data which is implemented in fixed-point
 arithmetic. The library can thus be used to implement super fast mp3 encoding
 on architectures without a FPU, such as armel, etc. In fact, it is also super
 fast on architectures with a FPU!
 .
 This package contains the core library.
